## Goals
I want to create a good use case or jumping off point to build streamlit applications around NLP models.
Typically we have to tag text or display results from models that might not be intuitive to the typical viewer.
These are some examples of ways we can empower NLP based models to be more user-friendly when it comes to sharing results.
